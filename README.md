# Fresnel Material
Fresnel material that creates rim lighting of 3D mesh. There is an option to use the fresnel effect to mask transparency of the mesh for rim lighting only. Pass in the alpha prop of the Torus component of the demo. Allows for fine tuning the effect with the power factor, bias factor, and rim color intensity.
